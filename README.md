EnchantMore - enchanted hoes, enchanted fishing rods, enchanted shears and more!

EnchantMore adds dozens of new item enchantment effects,
on flint & steel, hoes, shears, fishing rods, and other items --
ranging from entertainingly destructive to legitimately useful.

***[Download EnchantMore 2.0](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/enchantmore/files/12-enchant-more-2-0/)*** - released 2013/04/19 for 1.5.1-R0.2

## Features
* More than 80 new enchantment/item combinations
* Items in inventory appear as expected (glowing + descriptive tooltip) 
* No client mods required
* Only adds functionality, does not change any -- all your existing enchanted tools work as expected
* You can disable any effects in config.yml
* Supports enchantments on modded items

**Important**: to enchant items, you currently need to use an enchanting plugin or inventory editor. EnchantMore does not yet enchant items itself or alter enchantment tables. Known plugins compatible with EnchantMore:

* [EasyEnchant](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/easyenchant/) - see the Exception section in the config to enable/disable
* [Tim The Enchanter](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/enchanter/) - /enchant command for ops
* [AutoEnchanter](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/autoenchanter/) - set "unsafe" to true in config 
* [General](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/general/) - supported in v4.3+, enable in config

If you know of any other compatible plugins, let me know and I'll add them here. (If you're writing an enchanting plugin, use addUnsafeEnchantment() and 
ignore canEnchantItem(), then it should be compatible with EnchantMore.)
